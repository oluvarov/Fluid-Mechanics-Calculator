This project was made as a part of TCSS 460 course at UWT. Its purpose it to demonstrate my skills in working with Node.JS, Express-JS and REST API's.
I developed a group of services that calculae important values from fluid mechanics, allowing to simplify calculations and process for students who would take fluid mechanics course.
Besides REST API there is a simple web interface available.
