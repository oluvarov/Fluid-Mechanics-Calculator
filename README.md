# Fluid Mechanics Calculator

This project was made as a part of TCSS 460 course at UWT. Its purpose is to demonstrate my skills in working with Node.JS, Express-JS and REST APIâ€™s.

I developed a group of services that calculate important values from fluid mechanics, such as pressure, velocity and flow rate. This can help students who take fluid mechanics courses to simplify their calculations and processes.

## Usage
You can use this project as a web interface or as a REST API.

## Web Interface
The web interface is available and deployed on Heroku: https://morning-meadow-48971.herokuapp.com/

You can enter the input values for different fluid mechanics problems and get the output values displayed on the web page.

## Installation
If you want to run this project locally on your machine, you need to have Node.JS installed.

Then follow these steps:

***Clone this repository:*** git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/fluid-mechanics-calculator.git

***Go to the project directory:*** cd fluid-mechanics-calculator

***Install the dependencies:*** npm install

***Start the server:*** npm start

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000/ for the web interface or http://localhost:3000/api/ for the REST API.
